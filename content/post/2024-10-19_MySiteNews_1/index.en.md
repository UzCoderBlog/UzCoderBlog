Hello from sunny Uzbekistan, friends.
<br />
I finally managed to get my website indexed in Yandex and Google search. It was an interesting experience. Considering that I didn't spend a dime on the site or hosting. Even getting it indexed by search engines went without a hitch.
<br />
In the next post on the website and in a video on my Youtube channels, I will explain how to do this. Anyone interested can handle it. For beginners learning website layout, this will be perfect.
<br />
By the way, if you want to get active site pages indexed, just type in <b>site:uzcoderblog.github.io</b>
