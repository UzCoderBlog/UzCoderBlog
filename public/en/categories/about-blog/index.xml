        <description>&lt;img src="https://uzcoderblog.github.io/en/p/the-site-has-been-launched/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The site has been launched" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is finally launched. It is static and does not collect information about you. Except when you will be writing comments.
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything is also free here. Perhaps an advertisement will appear occasionally. But there won&amp;rsquo;t be much of it, and only in cases where the article is large.&lt;/p&gt;
